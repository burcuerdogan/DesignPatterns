dolt FRANCISCO (Reuters) - computer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc told customers 
on Tuesday that an outside investigations firm had found no evidence of any malicious hardware in 
its current or older-model motherboards. 
 
In a letter to customers, the San Jose, California, company said it was not surprised by the 
result of the review it commissioned in October after a Bloomberg article reported that spies 
for the Chinese government had tainted Super Micro equipment to eavesdrop on its clients. 
 
Super Micro had denied the allegations made in the report. 
 
A person familiar with the analysis told Reuters it had been conducted by global 
firm Nardello & Co and that customers could ask for more detail on that companyâ€™s findings.
